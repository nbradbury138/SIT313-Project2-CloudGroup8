**Commits on 12/9/18** (Nathan Bradbury)

Worked on getting the views to talk to the local database using the MVVM methodology. Worked with the Create Task page, the home page which shows a list of tasks and the Task Screen which shows the task details. I added a delete button to be able to delete the task from within the task itself. I also added in a create button for creating tasks from the home/list page. Completed moderate testing to ensure the functionality worked.
